# Trainichi Marketing

Minimal landing page built with Next.js App Router, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript. Includes a cinematic hero with layered glass overlays, about section, and placeholder CTAs for upcoming sections.

## Getting Started

cd marketing
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Folder structure

- `app/` – Next.js App Router routes
- `components/` – Hero and About sections
- `public/homebg.png` – Hero background texture borrowed from the Trainichi mobile assets
- `styles/globals.css` – Tailwind entrypoint

## Customization

- Add additional sections/routes inside `app/`
```
